# Selecting SSG tool

I want to write articles and release them on the Internet.

I have some goals/expectations to the writing activity.

- I want to write articles in Markdown files and
  generate static HTML pages using a static site generator (SSG).
- The SSG tool must be easy to install and setup, and
  it must support mathematical symbols, formula, and equations by default.
- The SSG tool must provide good documentation for not only advanced users
  but also for general users.
- Using the SSG tool must not require users to know a lot about
  the tool's underlying technologies, and
  it must be easy and quick to maintain the site.
- The default site design must be _reasonable_, i.e.,
  it must look simple and professional, and
  site navigation must be easy.

[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (MPL license) seems to
satisfy the above expectations well.
